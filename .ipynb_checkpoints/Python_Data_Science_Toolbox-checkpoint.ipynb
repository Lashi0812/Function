To define the function, We begin with the keyword def, followed by the function name square; this is then followed by a set of parentheses and a colon. This piece of code is called a function header. To complete the function definition, let's write the function body by squaring a value, say 4, and printing the output. Right now, our square function does not have any parameters within the parentheses. We will add them later. Now, whenever this function is called, the code in the function body is run. In this case, new_value is assigned the value of 4 ** 2 and then printed out. You can call the function as you do with pre-built functions: square. This should yield the value, 16."

Suppose that, instead of simply squaring a value, we'd like to raise a value to the power of another value that's also passed to the function. We can do this by having our function accept two parameters instead of just one. You should also change your function name AND docstrings to reflect this new behavior. raise_to_power is an appropriate function name. Notice that there are now two parameters in the function header instead of one, value1 and value2. In the lines after that, the behavior of the overall function was also changed by raising value1 to the power of value2. You can call the function by passing in two arguments because the function has two parameters, as declared in the function header. The order in which the arguments are passed correspond to the order of the parameters in the function header. This means that when we call raise_to_power(2, 3), when the function is executed, 2 would be assigned to value1 and 3 to value2. Looking at the function body, this means that the computation value1 to the power of value2 translates to 2 to the power of 3. This function call then returns the value 8."

    "We'll now talk about the idea of scope in the context of user-defined functions. You've been defining variables in your programs and so far, you've been using these variables without any problems. However, one thing you should know is that not all objects that you define are always accessible everywhere in a program. Enter the idea of scope, which tells you which part of a program an object or a name may be accessed. Names refer to the variables or, more generally, objects such as functions that are defined in your program, for example, a variable x has a name, as does the function sum. There are three types of scope that you should know. The first one is the idea of the global scope. A name that is in the global scope means that it is defined in the main body of a script or a Python program. The second one, is the local scope. A name that is in a local scope means that it is defined within a function. Once the execution of a function is done, any name inside the local scope ceases to exist, which means you cannot access those names anymore outside of the function definition. The third is something called the built-in scope: this consists of names in the pre-defined built-ins module Python provides, such as print and sum. You'll play around with the built-ins module in the interactive exercises."

Now look at what raise_vals returns: it returns the inner function inner! raise_vals takes an argument n and creates a function inner that returns the nth power of any number. That's a bit complicated and will be clearer when we use the function raise_vals. Passing the number 2 to raise_vals creates a function that squares any number. Similarly, passing the number 3 to raise_vals creates a function that cubes any number. One interesting detail: when we call the function square, it remembers the value n=2, although the enclosing scope defined by raise_val and to which n=2 is local, has finished execution. This is a subtlety referred to as a closure in Computer Science circles and shouldn't concern you too much. It is worth mentioning, however, as you may encounter it out there in the wild."

In this example, we alter the value of n in the inner function; because we used the keyword nonlocal, it also alter the value of n in the enclosing scope. This is why calling the function outer prints the value of n as determined within the function inner. You'll have practice using the keyword nonlocal in the interactive exercises."

You'll also learn about iterators, which you have already seen in the context of for loops without having necessarily known it. Iterators are everywhere in PythonLand and, to put it simply, allow you to rapidly iterate Data Science protocols and procedures over sets of objects; these are a couple of the cool functionalities in PythonLand you'll encounter in the sequel to this course, which will conclude with an entire chapter devoted to a case study in which you'll apply time and time again techniques learnt in both of these courses."
